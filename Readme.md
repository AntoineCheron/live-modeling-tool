# Live Modeling Tool

## Typical Use Case
User wants to produce a Boussinesq Simulation and see results, choosing the type of chart.

### Workflow
1. User inputs 4 files, containing entry data :
* geologic.input
* hydrologic.input
* morphologic.input
* key_spatialized_param.param

2. User launches simulation
3. User chooses which output data to display and with which chart.
